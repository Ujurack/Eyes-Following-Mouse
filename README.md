# Eyes-Following-Mouse
A short little program that has eyes following the mouse movements

I believe this could be optimised better, and when I looked at other eye following mosue programs they never seen to use the cosine or sine aproach, perhaps my way is inneficient. :l

One issue is I haven't made the eyes very manipulative in sizes. Right now they're at a 1:2 ratio, and in the drawBall method I times it by 4, which also means I have to stay at the 1:2 ratio for the eyes to look nice.
